This is a small widget for any BOINC project that shows a line chart, using Google Charts, with the total number of
registered users, new registered users and users with credit per day.

The widget has a slider that allows you to see the line chart over the last two months.

You can try it in the [LHC@Home 2.0 CERN project](http://boinc01.cern.ch/test4theory/users_last_week.php).
